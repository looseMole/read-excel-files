A project made for a tabletop game that includes rolling a lot of dice on a lot of tables.

A second attempt at my old [wildmagic-roller](https://github.com/looseMole/wildmagic-roller) project.

This project is made possible by the people behind openpyxl and defusedxml.
Executable and installer is made possible by PyInstaller and Inno Setup respectively.
